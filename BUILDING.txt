You will need to tell Maven that into which directory you have 
installed IDEA. You can do that by adding something like what follows 
into your settings.xml file and then build the project with the Maven 
command "mvn package -P idea-plugin"

<profile>
    <id>idea-plugin</id>
    <properties>
        <idea.version>103.255</idea.version>
        <idea.home>C:/Program Files (x86)/JetBrains/IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition 10.0.3</idea.home>
    </properties>
</profile>

And to build the project within IDEA, you will need to add idea.jar 
into the IDEA Plugin SDK.
